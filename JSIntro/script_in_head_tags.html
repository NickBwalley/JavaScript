<!--FAQ'S
Generally javascript code will function in the head before code in the body. The head section is usually used to contain information about the page that you dont neccessarily see like the meta keywords meta description or title of a page. You would also link to any external files like .css .js files in the head section as they need to load before the page is displayed.

Anything in the body section is what you would expect to be see on screen.
